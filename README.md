# Sunrise BLFCLI Import Helper
GUI made in VB.NET to make the process of importing saves slightly quicker. I found this useful when importing saves in bulk since it eliminates the need of me editing my command for each save. With this app you load your saves, click on each one &amp; the import variant command will be copied to your clipboard. Supports Halo 3 Final and Halo 3 ODST.

The latest update adds a couple more features:
- Map Variant Origin Finder
- Game_set.csv creation & the ability to set default settings for it
